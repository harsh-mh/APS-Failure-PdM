# APS-Failure-PdM

This project leverages machine learning techniques to address maintenance costs of the air pressure system (APS) in Scania trucks. The notebook explores data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to achieve optimal performance on the APS Failure dataset provided by Scania Trucks.

## Key Goals
- **Data Analysis**: Understanding and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Model Development**: Building and optimizing classification/regression models.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as ROC-AUC, precision, recall, or other relevant indicators.
- **Visualization**: Generating insights using plots such as ROC curves, confusion matrices, etc.

## Key Features
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Handles missing values, normalization, and multicollinearity reduction.
- **Model Selection**: Implements and compares different machine learning algorithms.
- **Interpretability**: Includes metrics and visualizations for better model insights.
- **Robust Evaluation**: Validates the model using cross-validation and independent test datasets.
